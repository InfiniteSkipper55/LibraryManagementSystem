**Project Description: Customized Library Management System**

**Overview:**
A Customized Library Management System is a robust and efficient Java-based command-line application designed to streamline library operations and enhance overall efficiency. This versatile system incorporates essential features such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both books and users, advanced search capabilities, book issuing, and serialization/deserialization for secure data storage. The system also includes an authentication mechanism, ensuring that only authorized administrators can perform certain functions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Book Management:**

   * Create, update, and delete book records.
   * Search for books based on various criteria like title, author, and genre.
   * Implement serialization to securely store book data.


2. **User Management:**

   * Add, update, and remove user details.
   * Implement user authentication for secure access.


3. **Book Issuing and Returning:**

   * Admins can issue books to users during their login session.
   * Track book availability and borrower details.
   * Allow users to return books, updating availability status.


4. **Fine Calculation:**

   * Calculate fines for overdue books.
   * Accept fine payments from users.

   
5. **Advanced Search:**

   * Provide advanced search functionality for flexible book retrieval.


6. **Admin Login Session:**

   * Authenticate administrators with a secure login mechanism.
   * Restrict certain functionalities to admin login sessions.
   

7. **Serialization and Deserialization:**

   * Store data securely using serialization in encrypted text files.
   * Retrieve and deserialize data for seamless system operation.


8. **Technical Details:**

   * **Programming Language:** Java
   * **Build System:** Gradle with Groovy DSL
   * **Database Connectivity:** JDBC for MySQL
   * **Security Measures:** Password hashing for user authentication
   * **Serialization Security:** Encryption using a secret key
   

**How It Benefits User:**

  * **Efficient Library Operations:** Automate and streamline day-to-day library tasks.
  * **Secure Data Handling:** Utilize encryption for data storage to ensure security.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** Command-line interface for ease of use.
  * **Customizable and Extendable:** The modular design allows for easy customization and future enhancements.
  

**Note:**

This project is adaptable to various library settings and can be further tailored to specific requirements. It provides a solid foundation for managing library resources while prioritizing data security and system efficiency.
